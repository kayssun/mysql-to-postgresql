mysql-to-postgresql
===================

I got this from here: http://www.gab.lc/scripts/php_my2pg.php


But it did not work for me. And since it is released under the
WTFPL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) I modified it and
here you go. Use at your own risk.


I added some more data types and support for copying binary objects.
